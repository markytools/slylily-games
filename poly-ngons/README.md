<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Up for a challenge? Poly N-gons is not just some ordinary game of polygons, but it is the most Poly N-gonized puzzle game of all polygon puzzles. Remember the time when you thought squares, triangles, rhombuses, and trapezoids were just boring shapes? If so, then remember not, for this game is the complete opposite. Poly N-gons introduces to you a new generation of puzzle games by making you solve puzzles created out of simple and boring polygons you learned in school. If a jigsaw puzzle needs to have the right piece at the right space, Poly N-gons need to have the right polygon at the right space, position, and angle! Complete puzzles by switching, flipping, and rotating different polygons together. Experience the fun of everlasting complexity as you play the game that defines complexity itself.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>You need to have the old version of libgdx to build these. Using older/later versions might produce code errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>LibGDX 1.5.5 (You can download it here: https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/old-site/releases/libgdx-1.5.5.zip)</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, just run the gdx-setup.jar inside the extracted folder. Use the following LibGDX settings:</p>
<p>Name: PolyNgons</p>
<p>Package: com.polyngons.game</p>
<p>Game Class: PolyNGons</p>
<p>Checks: Desktop</p>
<p>In the advance settings: Check Generate Eclipse project files</p>
