<p><strong>Connect Coins Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>You need to have the old version of libgdx to build these. Using older/later versions might produce code errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>LibGDX 1.9.8 (You can download it here: https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/releases?after=1.9.8)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, just run the gdx-setup.jar inside the extracted folder. Use the following LibGDX settings:</p>
<p>Name: Connect Coins</p>
<p>Package: com.connectcoins.game</p>
<p>Game Class: ConnectCoins</p>
<p>Checks: Desktop</p>
<p>In the advance settings: Check Generate Eclipse project files</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After setting up the project, open it in a new workspace in eclipse, then import the project folder. Copy the assets into the assets folder, then clean the project workspace.</p>
