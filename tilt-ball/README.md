<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Tilt is a fun ball game where you try to move the ball through numerous boxes by tilting the screen. The obstacles are randomly placed so you sometimes need to act quickly and go the right way. Try to navigate your way through the scattered boxes and try to make the ball stay in the game for as long as possible. Beat your own best time while at the same time still enjoying the game.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>You need to have the old version of libgdx to build these. Using older/later versions might produce code errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>LibGDX 1.5.5 (You can download it here: https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/old-site/releases/libgdx-1.5.5.zip)</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, just run the gdx-setup.jar inside the extracted folder. Use the following LibGDX settings:</p>
<p>Name: Tilt Ball</p>
<p>Package: com.tiltball.game</p>
<p>Game Class: TiltBall</p>
